# Setting up microservice using Flask and Docker

# Flask:
Flask is a super light, and easy-to-use micro web framework for Python.

This is a simple hello world program which displays Hello World! on the local host.

# Docker:
Docker is the company driving the container movement and the only container platform provider to address every application across the hybrid cloud.

A container image is a lightweight, stand-alone, executable package of a piece of software that includes everything needed to run it: code, runtime,
system tools, system libraries, settings
